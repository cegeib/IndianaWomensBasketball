At the end of the night after interviewing and taking photos of families and groups spending time together, I was observing the line of people waiting to get a signature from players and an elderly man with a bright, unique jacket stood out to me. I introduced myself and before even explaining the purpose of my group’s project and that I wanted to interview him, he was cheerfully talking to me and asking how my day was going. When I asked about his connections to the women’s basketball team, he nostalgically recalled the story of how he and his late wife’s first date was at an IU football game in 1953. He has followed both the IU men and women’s basketball teams more recently, but I could tell by his excitement talking about the teams and his connections with IU that IU women’s games and IU sports in general are a significant part of his life. Deep connections to IU sports is one of the main reasons we chose our topic, and stories we learned like this truly made this project worthwhile.
