This season Hoosier fans broke the record from 2018 of the highest attendance at a women's game in Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall. 13,046 people were in attendance to watch their number 2 ranked Hoosiers beat number 5 ranked Iowa. 

Player Grace Berger had an amazing season, and kept Indiana fans wanting to watch her and the team play. She is now the number 7 pick for the WNBA draft. The team was seeded second overall for the NCAA tournament and even reached as high as number two in the country in the coaches polls. 

Many students have been wanting the women’s team to get as much attention as the men’s team, and this season reflected that. Long time IUWBB fans came back, and new fans joined them as well. 

We wanted to get an inside look at the fanbase at the 2023 women’s games, we hope you enjoy meeting them!
