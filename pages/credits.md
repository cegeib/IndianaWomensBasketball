The group that created this project is sophomore Ruth Cronin, sophomore Caroline Geib, and junior Maddy Hildreth. We created this project for the class Introduction to Popular Culture at Indiana University. Ruth was the writer for the project, in charge of introducing the project and keeping track of our progress. Caroline was the technologist who created this website and Maddy was the producer who took all of our images.
